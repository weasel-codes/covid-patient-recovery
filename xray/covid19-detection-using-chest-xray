# Covid-19 Detection using Chest Xray

Understanding covid-19 became very important since large scale vaccination of this was not possible. Chest X-ray is the first imaging technique that plays an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Till now in vari- ous fields, great success has been achieved using convolutional neural networks(CNNs) for image recognition and classification. However, due to the limited availability of annotated medical images, the classification of medical images remains the biggest challenge in medical diagnosis. In our work, we performed transfer learning using deep learning models like Resnet50 and VGG16 and compare their performance with a newly developed CNN based model. Resnet50 and VGG16 are state of the art models and have been used extensively. A comparative analysis with them will give us an idea of how good our model is. We will be developing a CNN model as it is expected to perform really good on image classification related problems. For our research, we have used kaggle radiography dataset for training, validating and testing. Moreover, we have used another x-ray images dataset which we have created from two different sources. The result shows that CNN model developed by us outperforms VGG16 and Resnet50 model.
